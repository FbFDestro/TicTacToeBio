Educational Tic Tac Toe with biology questions. ETEP - 2014

The Game of Educational Tic Tac Toe was developed with the purpose of increasing the knowledge of biology, and was built using the Pascal programming language. The program consists of an educational game that is based on the default Tic Tac Toe game, with login and register of players. 
In the game the user must choose an option to mark, and will only mark the house if the user answers the question correctly. Anyone who can complete a column vertically, diagonally or horizontally first will be the winner.

I suggest you take a look at the screenshots folder to see the final result.
